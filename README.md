    All primary colors, fonts, and layout variables are located at the top of the `style.css` file within the `:root` selector. You can change the entire website's aesthetic by modifying these values.

    :root {
        --bg-dark: #0A0A14;

        --secondary-glow: #8A31CE;
        --text-primary: #F7FAFC;
        /* ...and so on */
    }
    ```
*   **Particle Animation:**
    The configuration for the `particles.js` animation can be found at the bottom of the `script.js` file. You can adjust the number of particles, their speed, color, and interactivity by changing the values in the `particlesJS` configuration object.
